## About
Version 2 of 2 phage database websites (Python and SQL)

The IWU Phages Database application is a user-friendly, web based application
for students to store information pertaining to bacteriophage research. This 
website is a way for universities to save important data relating to newly 
discovered bacteriophages, including student names, year of discovery, cluster
names, and more. 

Students can create an account, add new phages, edit existing phages, and view
other phages. Users who have not created an account cannot view sensitive 
information and students can only edit phages that they added. Faculty members
can access, edit and delete all phages by editing the code and permitting 
themselves access. 

For every phage, an activity log is created that keeps track of the time and 
activities that occur with each phage. This way, faculty can see who edits a 
phage and when.
